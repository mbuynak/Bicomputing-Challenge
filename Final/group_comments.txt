Comments for other group:
ORGANIZATION & DOCUMENTATION
- Better organization: naming folders by parts, not by group members, would make it easier to navigate
- Numbering parts or step number for descriptive file names
- Missing a lot of pseudocode and documentation
- Jupyter notebook for seeing output of code without running it
- Missing clear explanation of output

CODE:
- sortTranscripts.sh - good commenting, but stuff at the bottom might not be needed since it could be confusing
- translate.py - ok commenting, would like better descriptions of the functions used and more comments inside functions
- hmmbuild.sh - commenting is ok - would like a description of where your extra files are coming from
- finalhmmout.txt - looks like the output file, but would like some extra documentation about it so we know what it means

--- Comments for us ---
Error message in exercise3.py
Part3 run very long - optimization needed?
Pseudocode is different between Q1 and Q3 - better pseudocode in Q3
Check part1 null and alt hypothesis functions
Part1 - is the alt model actually called in the code
Informative commit messages
